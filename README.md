# SnugWork
SnugWork is a job application tracking platform that allows users to add, edit, delete & keep a list of their job applications whilst job hunting.

Built with NextJS, Drizzle, & Clerk. Hosted on Vercel & database hsoted by Neon.

I plan to add features every now and then in the future. Future update include backend analytics, search, among other things.
